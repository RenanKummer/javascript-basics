# JavaScript - Complete Guide

This project contains coding exercises from [JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2021 (Beginner + Advanced)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced) course available at [Udemy.com](https://udemy.com). Each section of the course has its own directory in this repository containing the proposed coding exercises.

## How do I run the exercises?

First of all, keep in mind that these are JavaScript exercises only, and most of them - if not all - are built around web pages alone. What this means is that the core knowledge obtained is not in what you see in the UI, but what you read in the JavaScript code.

That said, as of now all you have to do is open `{section-directory}/index.html` file in your browser.
